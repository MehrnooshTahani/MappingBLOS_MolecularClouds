## Authors and Contributors

The code was originially written by **Mehrnoosh Tahani**
 - written at the University of Calgary
 - updated at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (National Research Council Canada)

The code was updated in 2021 by **Jennifer Glover**
 - Undergraduate co-op Student (National Research Council Canada) 
   - Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory
   - University of Victoria

The code was updated in 2022 by **John Ming Ngo**
 - Undergraduate co-op Student (National Research Council Canada) 
   - Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory
   - University of Calgary

The code uses outputs of a chemical evolution code. Any chemical evolution code that provides abundances vs extinction (or column density) can be used. In this version we used outputs of a chemical evolution code developed by **Ren√© Plume**, at the University of Clagary.
